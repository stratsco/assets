*Welcome to the Strats Discord server!*
Strats is a multiplayer #gaming community. We're friendly people and we like to play games—usually together.

Please treat this Strats server with the same respect you would a public park. We, too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation. These are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized gaming discourse.

Please avoid...
- Name-calling.
- Ad hominem attacks.
- Responding to a message's tone instead of its actual content.
- Knee-jerk contradiction.
